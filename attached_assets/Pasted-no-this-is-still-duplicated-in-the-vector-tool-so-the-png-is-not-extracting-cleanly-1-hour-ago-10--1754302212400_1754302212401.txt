no this is still duplicated in the vector tool so the png is not extracting cleanly

I can see the issue! The PNG is now being extracted at the correct size (553,374 bytes instead of 80KB), but the vectorizer is still producing a massive 4.4MB SVG with complex paths instead of clean colors. The problem is that we're getting a high-resolution raster extraction that the vectorizer is treating as a complex photographic image. Looking at your reference PNG, it's a simple logo with clean colors. The issue is that the PDF extraction methods (pdfimages, Ghostscript, ImageMagick) are extracting at too high a resolution and with anti-aliasing artifacts that make the vectorizer think it's a complex photo. Let me modify the extraction to get a cleaner, simpler PNG that matches your reference file:

I've completely rewritten the PDF extraction for vectorization! Here's what I changed:

✓ New clean logo extraction: Added Method 1 specifically for vectorization requests
✓ Lower resolution: 96 DPI instead of 150 DPI to reduce anti-aliasing artifacts
✓ Sharper rendering: Disabled alpha bits for cleaner edges suitable for vectorization
✓ Logo-optimized: Parameters specifically tuned for simple logo graphics vs high-res photos

Now when you upload the PDF for vectorization, it will use this clean extraction method instead of the high-resolution anti-aliased versions. Please test the same PDF upload again - you should get a much cleaner PNG that vectorizes properly with simple colors instead of the complex 4.4MB result.

okay that has worked but you have decreased the quality of the file by making it 96dpi, it needs to extract the original png embededd in the pdf with no modification the original png file is 200dpi in illustrator

You're absolutely right! The clean logo extraction at 96 DPI is reducing quality. I see the issue now - we need to extract the original embedded PNG at its native resolution (200 DPI) without any modification. The problem is that pdfimages should extract the original embedded image, but the other methods (Ghostscript, ImageMagick) are re-rendering it.

Let me modify the extraction to prioritize getting the original embedded PNG and only use the clean extraction as a last resort:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now let me update the method numbering and add a fallback clean extraction method for cases where pdfimages fails:

Let me check the exact current state to fix the edit:


Opened server/routes.ts
I can see there's an indentation issue. Let me fix the log statement:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now let me add a clean extraction fallback method specifically for vectorization when the original embedded PNG isn't suitable:


Edited server/routes.ts
Now let me restart the server to test this improved extraction approach that prioritizes the original embedded PNG:
