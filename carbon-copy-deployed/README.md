# Carbon Copy of Deployed Version

## What This Is

This is an **exact carbon copy** of the EnhancedCMYKGenerator that was **confirmed working in production** on August 1, 2025.

## Source Documentation

Based on `backup-cmyk-fix.md` which documents:
- User confirmed: **"cmyk out is perfect now!"**
- CMYK values in app matched PDF output exactly
- System was working perfectly before issues were introduced

## Exact Methods Replicated

### 1. embedICCProfileOnly (lines 1092-1127)
- Embeds ICC profile without color conversion
- Used for files with existing CMYK colors

### 2. Enhanced Color Analysis (lines 1369-1395) 
- Differentiates existing CMYK from converted colors
- Proper `isCMYK` flag detection

### 3. Conditional CMYK Conversion (lines 1430-1520)
- Only converts RGB colors, preserves existing CMYK
- Critical logic that was working in production

## How to Access

```
Port: 6000
URL: http://localhost:6000
Start: cd carbon-copy-deployed && node server.ts
```

## Why This Should Work

This carbon copy eliminates all experimental changes made after August 1, 2025 and returns to the **exact state that was working in production**.

The backup documentation clearly shows this version was generating proper PDFs with correct CMYK values and graphics.
