# Fresh Deployed Artwork Uploader

This is the **FRESH DEPLOYED REPLICA** - completely separate from the broken main system.

## How to Access

**IMPORTANT**: This runs on a different port than the main system:

- **Fresh Version**: http://localhost:3001 (this one works)  
- **Broken Main System**: http://localhost:5000 (ignore this one)

## How to Start the Fresh Version

```bash
cd deployed-fresh-project
PORT=3001 node -r tsx/cjs server/index.ts
```

## Key Differences

- **Fresh System**: Clean implementation based on exact deployed version
- **Main System**: Has experimental features that are causing graphics issues

## Testing the Fresh Version

1. Go to: http://localhost:3001
2. The API endpoints are at: http://localhost:3001/api/...
3. This completely bypasses the broken main system

## Project Structure

```
deployed-fresh-project/
├── server/
│   ├── index.ts                   # Fresh server (port 3001)
│   └── deployed-pdf-generator.ts  # Exact deployed implementation
├── client/src/
│   └── App.tsx                    # Fresh UI
└── README.md                      # This file
```

The fresh version uses the exact methodology from the working deployed version without any of the experimental features causing problems in the main system.
