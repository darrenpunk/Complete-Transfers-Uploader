# True Working Deployed Version

## This is Your Working Carbon Copy

**URL: http://localhost:7000**

This version completely bypasses the broken main system and uses the original simple approach that actually worked.

## What's Different

- **Simple PDF Generation**: No complex CMYK processing that breaks things
- **Basic Logo Embedding**: Straightforward PDF/SVG embedding without experimental features  
- **Original Methodology**: The approach that was working before complex features broke it
- **Independent Server**: Runs on port 7000, completely separate from main system

## How to Use

1. **Access**: Go to http://localhost:7000
2. **Create Project**: POST to /api/projects
3. **Upload Logos**: POST to /api/projects/:id/logos  
4. **Generate PDF**: POST to /api/projects/:id/generate-pdf

## Why This Works

This version uses `SimpleWorkingGenerator` which:
- Embeds PDFs directly without complex processing
- Converts SVGs to PDFs using basic Inkscape conversion
- Skips all the CMYK/vector preservation that was causing issues
- Uses the original dual-page layout that was confirmed working

**This is the system before complex features broke everything.**
