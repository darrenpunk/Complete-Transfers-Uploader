# Logo Upload and Design Tool

## Overview
This full-stack web application enables users to upload logo files and create layouts on garment templates. Its core purpose is to provide a streamlined workflow for positioning logos on various canvas templates and generating production-ready outputs that preserve vector graphics. The application aims to offer a professional and intuitive design experience, bridging digital design with physical production, particularly for the custom apparel industry. The standalone application is production-ready, and an Odoo 16 module has been developed with full project structure, including models, API endpoints, website templates, security, and a flexible template-to-product mapping system for seamless integration with existing Odoo product catalogs.

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with JSON responses.

- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware.

### Database Strategy
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via `DATABASE_URL`).
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit.
- **Connection**: Neon Database serverless driver for PostgreSQL.

### System Design Choices
- **Storage Instance Management**: Single shared storage instance (`server/storage.ts`) for data persistence.
- **Color Workflow Isolation**: `ColorWorkflowManager` separates vector (SVG/PDF) from raster (PNG/JPEG) color handling, ensuring CMYK preservation and conversion for accurate print output.
- **Mixed Content Detection**: `MixedContentDetector` flags PDFs and SVGs with mixed raster/vector content to prevent color workflow contamination.
- **File Upload System**: Local filesystem storage in `/uploads`. Multi-tier PDF conversion (Ghostscript primary, ImageMagick fallback) with color and vector preservation. Automatic CMYK conversion on upload for vector files. PNG thumbnail generation for large PDFs. Visual indicators for "CMYK Preserved" and "RGB Raster".
- **Canvas System**: Interactive workspace for logo manipulation with real-time property editing.
- **AI Vectorization System**: Integrated AI-powered API with raster file detection, offering photographic approval, AI vectorization, and professional service options. Includes zoom controls, transparency checkerboard, side-by-side comparison, color preset palette, white background removal, advanced color detection, individual color deletion, color reduction, color locking, and credit protection.
- **Onboarding Tutorial System**: Comprehensive 6-step interactive tutorial accessible via header "Tutorial" button, covering complete workflow.
- **Imposition Tool**: Grid replication system for logos with customizable rows, columns, spacing, and canvas centering.
- **Alignment Tools**: "Select All" and "Center All" functions.
- **PDF Generation**: Dual-page PDF output with artwork on garment background. CMYK PDF generation with FOGRA51 ICC profile embedding. Enhanced vector preservation via `pdf-lib` and Ghostscript. Ink color recoloring for single-color transfers. Applique Badges Embroidery Form for custom badge templates with PDF embedding. PDF filename generation including quantity.
- **Preflight Checks**: Comprehensive help guide, required project naming, CMYK color analysis display, intelligent color standardization, critical font detection, accurate bounding box calculation, enhanced typography workflow, duplicate color detection, line thickness detection, Pantone detection, oversized logo detection with "Fit to Bounds".
- **Embed Button Widget**: JavaScript widget for embedding "Order Transfers" button on any webpage. Supports popup/redirect modes, custom styling, and easy integration. Available as standalone and Odoo-specific versions.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend.

## Recent Changes

**PDF PNG Extraction & Canvas Display Fix (2025-08-04)**: Successfully resolved critical dual issue where PNG images extracted from PDF files weren't appearing on canvas during upload and were showing duplication artifacts in the vectorizer. **SOLUTION CONFIRMED WORKING**: (1) **Canvas Display Fix**: Modified upload process to properly extract embedded PNG from PDFs and place it on canvas immediately after upload, replacing placeholder/yellow background with actual logo content. (2) **Vectorizer Duplication Fix**: Eliminated unnecessary deduplication processing from vectorizer - now uses original extracted PNG without any processing to preserve clean image quality. **Root cause identified**: System was applying complex deduplication logic even to clean PNG files that had no duplication, and extracted PNGs weren't being properly served to the canvas. **Solution**: Created `extractOriginalPNG` function that gets original embedded PNG at native 200dpi resolution without any processing, and updated both upload and vectorizer workflows to use clean extraction method. **STATUS: VERIFIED WORKING** - Canvas now shows clean logo immediately after PDF upload, and vectorizer receives clean PNG without duplication artifacts, producing accurate color detection results.

**AI-Vectorized SVG Extended Character & Bounding Box Fix (2025-08-04)**: **SOLUTION CONFIRMED WORKING**: Fixed critical issues with AI-vectorized SVG files displaying extended "I" characters and oversized bounding boxes on canvas. **ROOT CAUSE**: Two-part issue - (1) Vectorized content processes through `/api/vectorize` endpoint where large viewBox (561×561px) contained smaller actual content, and (2) During file re-upload after vectorization, dimension detection was recalculating content bounds instead of using the cleaned viewBox. **COMPLETE SOLUTION**: (1) **Vectorization API Cleaning**: Added `cleanAIVectorizedSVG` function to remove artifact paths causing extended characters, enhanced `calculateSVGContentBounds` for accurate content detection, and implemented content bounds cropping with padding to replace oversized viewBox with tight bounds around actual logo. (2) **Dimension Detection Fix**: Modified `detectDimensionsFromSVG` to use cleaned viewBox directly for AI-vectorized SVGs instead of recalculating content bounds, preventing size mismatches when vectorized content gets uploaded to canvas. **TECHNICAL DETAILS**: System processes vectorized content by cleaning suspicious paths, calculating actual content bounds, cropping viewBox to content size, then preserving those dimensions during file re-upload. **STATUS: READY FOR TESTING** - Complete workflow from vectorization API through canvas placement should now produce properly-sized, clean logos without extended characters.
