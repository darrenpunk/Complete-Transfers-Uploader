# Logo Upload and Design Tool

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application for uploading logo files and designing layouts on garment templates. The application provides a workflow-based interface where users can upload logos, position them on canvas templates, and generate production-ready outputs with preserved vector graphics. It's built with a modern React frontend and Express.js backend, using PostgreSQL for data persistence.

## Recent Changes (July 26, 2025)

### White Element Visibility Issue Resolution
**Problem**: White fills and light-colored elements in uploaded PDFs were completely invisible in the application
**Root Causes**: 
1. Frontend CSS rules globally hiding all white elements with `display: none !important`
2. Server-side SVG processing aggressively removing ALL white fills and rectangles
**Solution**: 
1. Removed aggressive CSS hiding rules from `client/src/index.css`
2. Updated server-side processing in `routes.ts` to selectively remove only full-page backgrounds while preserving white content elements
3. Applied hot reload fixes ensuring immediate visibility of white elements
**Result**: White text, logos, and design elements now display correctly in the canvas

### Dark Mode Implementation with Custom Branding
**Implementation**: Full dark mode interface with #961E75 primary color replacing blue theme
**Changes**: 
1. Updated CSS variables for comprehensive dark theme coverage
2. Created ThemeProvider component for theme persistence
