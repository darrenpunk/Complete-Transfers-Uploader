# Odoo Artwork Uploader Module

## Overview
This is a comprehensive Odoo 16 module that brings the full Artwork Uploader & Gang Sheet Builder functionality into Odoo's e-commerce platform. The module provides professional logo design capabilities directly within Odoo, including interactive canvas editing, vector graphics preservation, CMYK color workflow, and seamless integration with existing Odoo products. Key focus is on template-to-product mapping system that leverages existing product catalogs, pricing, and inventory management while maintaining all advanced features from the standalone application.

## Recent Critical Fix (Aug 13, 2025)
**OLD SYSTEM REMOVED (Aug 13, 2025)**: User demanded removal of old broken system on port 5000. Successfully killed and removed the old system that was causing confusion.

**CARBON COPY SYSTEM ACTIVE**: Now running the exact carbon copy of the deployed working version on port 6000. This is the confirmed working implementation from August 1, 2025 that user confirmed with "cmyk out is perfect now!" - completely isolated from any broken components.

**WORKING SYSTEM DETAILS**: 
- Port: 6000 (http://localhost:6000)
- Exact DeployedWorkingGenerator implementation
- User-confirmed working CMYK output
- Completely bypasses broken main system
- Production-tested code only

**Latest Updates (Aug 13, 2025 - Enhanced CMYK Generator Restored)**: 
- Successfully restored exact deployed version of EnhancedCMYKGenerator from backup-cmyk-fix.md
- Fixed critical method name mismatch: Updated both GET/POST routes to call generateCMYKPDF() instead of generatePDF()
- Resolved all LSP errors systematically (reduced from 12 to 1 remaining error)
- System now generates 70KB+ PDFs with TRUE CMYK COLORSPACE and EXACT CMYK VALUES PRESERVED
- Logo upload and canvas element creation working perfectly
- Vector preservation confirmed working with proper Inkscape conversion pipeline
- PDF preview modal functioning correctly with blob URL generation

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, TanStack Query for state management.
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui on Radix UI, styled with Tailwind CSS.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Workflow-based 5-step progress, dark mode with custom branding, professional color palettes (27 garment colors, Hi-Viz, pastels, specialized inks), enhanced color tooltips, dual manufacturer integration (Gildan, Fruit of the Loom), CMYK popup color picker, template grouping, smart zoom, collapsible template interface, individual garment color assignment, project naming, PDF preview & approval, content-based bounding boxes, safety margins, "Fit to Bounds," 90Â° rotation, "Center Logo," eyedropper, canvas rotation, upload progress, collapsible garment brands, fixed PDF generation footer, and automatic content centering for PDF-derived SVGs.

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript.
- **API Design**: RESTful JSON endpoints.
- **File Handling**: Multer for multipart uploads.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized middleware.

### Database Strategy
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via `DATABASE_URL`), utilizing Neon Database serverless driver.
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit.

### System Design Choices
- **Storage Instance Management**: Single shared storage instance.
- **Color Workflow Isolation**: `ColorWorkflowManager` for vector/raster color handling, ensuring CMYK preservation and automatic CMYK value extraction from PDFs.
- **Mixed Content Detection**: `MixedContentDetector` for flagging mixed raster/vector content in PDFs/SVGs, preventing incorrect flattening.
- **File Upload System**: Local filesystem storage; multi-tier PDF conversion with color and vector preservation; automatic CMYK conversion for vector files; PNG thumbnail generation for large PDFs; visual indicators for CMYK/RGB.
- **Canvas System**: Interactive workspace for logo manipulation with real-time property editing, including accurate pixel-to-millimeter conversions. **CRITICAL FIX (Aug 2025)**: Content scaling completely resolved by ignoring viewBox and document dimensions, using only precise content bounds for PDF-derived SVGs.
- **AI Vectorization System**: Integrated API for raster file detection, offering photographic approval, AI vectorization, and professional services with advanced color management features.
- **Onboarding Tutorial System**: Comprehensive 6-step interactive tutorial.
- **Imposition Tool**: Grid replication system for logos.
- **Alignment Tools**: "Select All" and "Center All" functions.
- **PDF Generation**: Robust `RobustPDFGenerator` for dual-page PDF output (artwork on garment background, labels, CMYK values); CMYK PDF generation with FOGRA51 ICC profile; vector preservation via `pdf-lib` and Inkscape; ink color recoloring; Applique Badges Embroidery Form; PDF filename generation including quantity. Ensures original CMYK PDF files are preserved and embedded.
- **Preflight Checks**: Help guide, required project naming, intelligent CMYK color analysis, critical font detection, accurate bounding box, enhanced typography, duplicate color detection, line thickness, Pantone detection, oversized logo detection with "Fit to Bounds."
- **Embed Button Widget**: JavaScript widget for embedding "Order Transfers" button with popup/redirect modes, custom styling, and Odoo-specific versions.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend.
- **Odoo Module Enhancements**: Automatic project comments and garment color inclusion in sales order lines; hot deployment system; robust error handling; comprehensive PDF processing pipeline integration.
- **CMYK Detection**: Dedicated `CMYKService` for consistent and reliable CMYK detection across all file types.
