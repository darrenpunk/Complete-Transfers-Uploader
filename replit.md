# Logo Upload and Design Tool

## Overview
This full-stack web application enables users to upload logo files and create layouts on garment templates. Its core purpose is to provide a streamlined workflow for positioning logos on various canvas templates and generating production-ready outputs that preserve vector graphics. The application aims to offer a professional and intuitive design experience, bridging digital design with physical production, particularly for the custom apparel industry. The standalone application is production-ready, and an Odoo 16 module has been developed with full project structure, including models, API endpoints, website templates, security, and a flexible template-to-product mapping system for seamless integration with existing Odoo product catalogs.

### Database Strategy
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via `DATABASE_URL`).

### System Design Choices
- **Storage Instance Management**: Single shared storage instance (`server/storage.ts`) for data persistence.
- **Color Workflow Isolation**: `ColorWorkflowManager` separates vector (SVG/PDF) from raster (PNG/JPEG) color handling, ensuring CMYK preservation and conversion for accurate print output.
- **Mixed Content Detection**: `MixedContentDetector` flags PDFs and SVGs with mixed raster/vector content to prevent color workflow contamination.
- **File Upload System**: Local filesystem storage in `/uploads`. Multi-tier PDF conversion (Ghostscript primary, ImageMagick fallback) with color and vector preservation. Automatic CMYK conversion on upload for vector files. PNG thumbnail generation for large PDFs. Visual indicators for "CMYK Preserved" and "RGB Raster".
- **Canvas System**: Interactive workspace for logo manipulation with real-time property editing.
- **AI Vectorization System**: Integrated AI-powered API with raster file detection, offering photographic approval, AI vectorization, and professional service options. Includes zoom controls, transparency checkerboard, side-by-side comparison, color preset palette, white background removal, advanced color detection, individual color deletion, color reduction, color locking, and credit protection.
- **Onboarding Tutorial System**: Comprehensive 6-step interactive tutorial accessible via header "Tutorial" button, covering complete workflow.
- **Imposition Tool**: Grid replication system for logos with customizable rows, columns, spacing, and canvas centering.
- **Alignment Tools**: "Select All" and "Center All" functions.
- **PDF Generation**: Dual-page PDF output with artwork on garment background. CMYK PDF generation with FOGRA51 ICC profile embedding. Enhanced vector preservation via `pdf-lib` and Ghostscript. Ink color recoloring for single-color transfers. Applique Badges Embroidery Form for custom badge templates with PDF embedding. PDF filename generation including quantity.
- **Preflight Checks**: Comprehensive help guide, required project naming, CMYK color analysis display, intelligent color standardization, critical font detection, accurate bounding box calculation, enhanced typography workflow, duplicate color detection, line thickness detection, Pantone detection, oversized logo detection with "Fit to Bounds".
- **Embed Button Widget**: JavaScript widget for embedding "Order Transfers" button on any webpage. Supports popup/redirect modes, custom styling, and easy integration. Available as standalone and Odoo-specific versions.
- **Monorepo Structure**: Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend.

## Recent Changes

**Direct PDF Rendering Implementation (2025-08-04)**: **BREAKTHROUGH SOLUTION - NO EXTRACTION, DIRECT RENDERING** - Implementing user's suggestion to copy PDF content directly without any extraction or modification that causes duplication artifacts. **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**: All extraction methods (`pdfimages`, PDF.js-extract) modify, rasterize, or process the embedded content, causing duplication artifacts and sizing issues. **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: (1) **Direct PDF-to-PNG Rendering**: Uses `pdf2pic` to render PDF page directly as PNG without extracting/modifying embedded content. (2) **No Extraction Processing**: Bypasses all extraction tools that cause artifacts by rendering the PDF page as-is. (3) **Optimal Resolution**: Renders at 150 DPI with 800px max dimensions to balance quality and size. **Technical Implementation**: Replaced extraction logic with direct PDF page rendering using `pdf2pic` library, preserving original PDF layout and embedded content exactly as designed. **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Clean PDF rendering without duplication artifacts, maintaining original design integrity and providing perfect vectorization input. **STATUS: TESTING** - Direct rendering approach that eliminates extraction-based artifacts completely.

**Vector.AI API Parameters Fix (2025-08-04)**: **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Root cause of poor vectorization quality was using incorrect API parameter names that don't exist in Vector.AI's API. **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**: Researched official Vector.AI API documentation and replaced all incorrect parameters with authentic documented ones: `format`, `svg.version`, `svg.group_by`, `shapes.fitting`, `shapes.mode`, `curves.line/arc/cubic/quadratic`, `gap_filler`, and `processing.max_colors`. Previous parameters like `processing.background_removal`, `shapes.stroke_style`, and `processing.curve_fitting` were non-existent API parameters. **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**: Updated `/api/vectorize` endpoint to use correct parameter names, enabled high-quality shape recognition with `shapes.fitting=true`, all curve types for optimal quality, gap filler for clean edges, and 256 color limit for crisp results. **EXPECTED OUTCOME**: Should now produce Vector.AI web app quality vectorization results matching external vectorizer applications. **STATUS: TESTING REQUIRED** - Need user confirmation that vectorization quality now matches professional Vector.AI web app standard.
